First, specify hyperparameters in Parameters.py

To train the model: 
Run python main.py 
Every 80 episodes, model weights and training data are stored in the checkpoints folder
After all the training is done, the model is stored in save_model folder

To test the model:
Run python main.py, but change TRAIN = false and TEST = TRUE
general_compare(DQN_test,0,50):
	the first number is to specify which trained model to test with index (e.g. model_0)
	the second number specifies which size of testing instances to use.

Currently, model 0 - 10  are stored in save_model folder
